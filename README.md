# ewb-msu-new-website

This is a repo for the website we are making for the Montana State University chapter of Engineers Without Borders. This website is written using the standard web dev languages like HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. It also uses AngularJS to keep all of the application logic safely separated from the UI, that way our design team can rapidly change the UI of the site without breaking all of the code that the dev team writes.

If you would like to help out with the coding or design aspects of this project, please email brandonsladek@gmail.com

This is going to be awesome!
